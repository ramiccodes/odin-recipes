        <p>Filipino-style spaghetti is an interesting take on the Italian bolognese. Made with banana 
            catsup and hot dogs, it's not your ordinary pasta dish! It's meaty, perfectly sweet and savory, and 
            cheesy for the ultimate midday snack or main dish.</p>

        <h2 class="spagsteps">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot over medium heat, cook spaghetti in salted boiling water according 
                to package's direction for about 7 to 9 minutes or until firm to bite. Drain 
                well.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, heat oil. Add sliced hot dogs and cook, stirring 
                occasionally, for about 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from 
                pan and set aside.</li>
