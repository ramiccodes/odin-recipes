        <img src="https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/filipino-style-spaghetti-sweet-style-4-730x1095.jpg">
        <p>Filipino-style spaghetti is an interesting take on the Italian bolognese. Made with banana 
            catsup and hot dogs, it's not your ordinary pasta dish! It's meaty, perfectly sweet and savory, and 
            cheesy for the ultimate midday snack or main dish.</p>

            <li>1/2 cup quick-melt cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot over medium heat, cook spaghetti in salted boiling water according 
                to package's direction for about 7 to 9 minutes or until firm to bite. Drain 
                well.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, heat oil. Add sliced hot dogs and cook, stirring 
                occasionally, for about 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from 
                pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add onions, garlic, and bell peppers to pan. Cook until softened. </li>
            <li>Add ground beef and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking into small 
                pieces until lightly browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, ketchup, and beef broth. Stir in sugar. </li>
            <li>Bring to a boil and then lower heat to simmer, covered, for about one hour or 
                until meat is fully cooked and sauce is thickened. If the sauce is getting too 
                thick, add water in 1/2 cup increments as needed. </li>
            <li>During the last 10 minutes of cooking, add browned hot dogs. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>To serve, spoon spaghetti sauce over noodles and top with shredded cheese.</li>
