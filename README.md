# odin-recipes
This is going to be my first HTML project made in courtesy of The Odin Project.
This project asks to do a simple website recipe page using HTML.
As of starting this project, I have learned the basics of HTML like paragraphs, headings, images, and links. (March 7, 2022)

Update: (March 17, 2022) - I have learned basic CSS styling like color, background-color, and font-family and have applied it to the HTML file.
